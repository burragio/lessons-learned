With any new endeavor, we undoubtedly make assumptions. However, when developing new software, it is vital that we consciously make assumptions. These assumptions ensure we fully understand their validity in order to sidestep project or computer failure during the development process and use. Assumptions, in a way, provide the underlying story of how the software will behave in practice, thus they are an effective tool in the development process. And not only, should we consciously document and vet our assumptions with the software engineers and design decision makers, we must test each assumption. Testing assumptions is a best practice and an ongoing one. Testing can be done in many forms: surveying target / impacted users, or observing outcomes on the front / back end. Important to note is that some assumptions will not be revealed until other assumptions are made invalid. Good practices include: identify, capture, structure, document, update, continually review and revalidate rational, assumptions, and decisions underlying them.
