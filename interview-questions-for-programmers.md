When hiring programmers, there are five main questions a business person should ask: (1) which version control system they use, (2) which framework they use, (3) which unit testing tool they use, (4) what they compared all of the above to and (5) why they picked all of the above over other options.  These questions are meant to ensure that the programmer is not attempting to build his or her own framework and is working with an established one and that s/he has given all of the above some thought.  These questions may also help establish a certain level of credibility, since the programmer will know that the business person has a working knowledge of what they do.
